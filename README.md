# SentimentAnalytics

Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis using Python. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for interactively analyzing text data and a CSV dataset for processing.
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone of a piece of text. It classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral based on the words and expressions used

Files
Sentiment Analysis.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for sentiment analysis with detailed explanations and interactive analysis.
dataset.csv - CSV file containing sample text data for sentiment classification.

Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies using:

bash
Copy

pip install -r requirements.txt  
Dependencies include:

nltk - Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.
textblob - Library for processing textual data.
pandas - Data analysis and manipulation tool.
matplotlib - Library for visualizing sentiment results.
Usage
Running the Jupyter Notebook
Open a terminal and run:
